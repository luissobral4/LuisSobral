          description="Hi! My name is LuÃ­s, I'm now in my last year in the Computer Science Master Course at University of Minho and computer science has always been something i enjoyed, even since the first day i started. I'm specialized in distributed systems and applications engineering."
          description2="I am looking forward to continuing to grow professionally and personally. In 2021 I spent some time solving Haskell tasks on a Platform called Fiverr and learned to deal with client requests in a given delivery time. This year I joined a Just a Change International Camp In in Obidos, for 14 days I was with other Portuguese and International volunteers restoring houses in inhuman conditions and it was a really great experience that contributed to my personal growth."
          description3="In the future, I expect to face challenging experiences, keep working and knowing different people, and improve my Computer Science skills. "
